              <span class="clhl">Most projects see a sharp drop during the weekend: these coincide with projects owned/managed by companies, which makes sense due to the working week and most employees resting during the weekends.
              Some notable exceptions do not show this sharp drop, like Pandas, Numpy and Flask (and some others to a lesser extent). These actually happen to be mostly community-driven projects</span>.<br><br>

              We see that <span class="clhl">all projects follow a similar hourly distribution</span>: the activity increases to <span class="clhl">reach a peak, then decreases constantly and hits a minimum for 6 to 8 hours</span> or so. <br>This corresponds to <strong>most of the commits happening during the working period</strong>, with the least activity happening during the evening and at night.<br>
              For <strong>team-driven projects</strong>, a lot of the work will be happening during the <strong>work hours</strong>. For <strong>other projects</strong> and contributors in general, the contributors will also be following <strong>daily schedules</strong> (i.e. they sleep at night). <br> <br>
              While projects will have contributors from all around the world, the majority is likely to be from specific countries (e.g. China, India and the US are respectively ranked 1st, 2nd and 3rd in terms of Internet users, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_Internet_users" target="_blank">source</a>) or specific to that project (e.g. Nerv's distribution is shifted towards the right, which coincides with the fact that a chunk of its community is Chinese).</span> </p>

              <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">To find out if some projects are heavily contributed to by specific communities or teams, we analyzed the proportion of commits whose committers or authors share non-common email domains (e.g. "@microsoft.com" would be considered, but "@gmail.com" would be ignored). We only focused on the top 5 domains for each project that are responsible for at least 1% of the project's commits.<br><br>
                We noticed that <span class="clhl">projects could be divided into two groups: community-driven ones, and company-backed/sponsored one</span>. <span class="clhl">In all cases, we see the presence of a (relatively) small but vital development team.</span><br><br>
                A clear example of a company-backed project is CNTK, for which Microsoft employees author 86% of the project's commits! (Other examples include Spark, Caffe2 and Angular.)<br>
                On the other hand, an example of a community-driven project is Flask, where the project's core maintainers are responsible for 41% of all commits.<br>

                <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">We consider code refactoring to be restructuring existing code without changing functionality, which in our experience is accompanied by a non-negligible decrease in lines of code. We analyzed the tendency of a committer to remove lines and looking only at authors with a high tendency to do so (at least 10% of their overall work is removing lines of code). This was done for a more robust measure.<br>
                  We found out that on average, <span class="clhl">around 7% of authors mostly remove code. It looks like a good chunk of authors have a particular role: refactoring code</span>.</p>

                    We found out that, <strong>on average, 55% (stddev=10%) of authors are involved with dealing with issues / bugs</strong>.<br>This shows the importance of this activity, and indicates that the role is distributed over a wide range of authors. This makes sense because each author can be responsible for a portion of the project, or some authors focus on issues that affect them personally.<br>
                    In short, <span class="clhl">dealing with issues is an important role which involves half of a project's contributors on average</span>. </p>

                    <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">When multiple people work on a single project, merging their work and resolving any conflicts in their changes is often required. We conducted a similar analysis on commit messages, this time looking for keywords related to merging. We found out that, on average <strong>19% (stddev=11%) of authors are involved with dealing with merges</strong>.<br>
                      This suggests that <span class="clhl">dealing with merges is a non-negligible role involving around one-fifth of a project's contributors on average</span>.</p>

                        To check for the existence of this role, we analyze contributors responsible for closing a significant portion of issues (at least 5%) for each project.<br>
                        We noticed that <strong>on average, a couple of users (mean=3, stddev=1.3) close a sizeable amount of issues</strong>.

                          However, there are still some noticeable differences between these three categories: the commit messages are mostly full of neutral sentiments. This is expected since commit messages have a descriptive and informative function (to provide concisely and objectively the commit's purpose); while GitHub issues also have mostly neutral sentiments, the amount of positive sentiments (on average ~4.6% with stddev ~1.5%) is significantly higher than the negative ones (on average ~0.5% with stddev ~0.5%).<br><br>

                            This is highly variable from one project to another, with some projects being much faster in resolving issues (a couple of weeks), and other beings much slower (a few months). The big range of the resolution time is likely due to the nature of the project and its issues, some projects/issues being inherently more complex than others. This means that issues require more time to properly debug and fix. Still, the projects are responsive in most cases, with the 2nd quartile (50%) of average issue resolution time being a couple of months on average. This makes sense considering the amount of time required to inquire about the issue, debug it, fix it and test the final outcome.<br><br>

                                  <li><span class="focus"><strong>Common patterns:</strong></span> these patterns are visible throughout the projects we analysed.</li>
                                  <ul class="text-white-50 text-lg-left">
                                    <li><span class="focus">Commit summary length:</span> just as recommended by git guides, an important portion of commits has a summary of around 50 characters. Summaries should be clear and concise.</li>
                                    <li><span class="focus">Closing GitHub issues</span>: another common pattern is resolving GitHub issues, showing the importance of being active and staying on top of them.</li>
                                    <li><span class="focus">Average GitHub issue resolution time</span>: most issues are resolved within a couple of months on average, taking into consideration the time for any discussion, development and testing.</li>
                                    <li><span class="focus">Frequency of commits</span>: on average, a new commit is made at least every day. (Alternatively, a line of code is committed every 15 minutes on average.)</li>
                                    <li><span class="focus">Daily/hourly activity</span>: most projects seem to have a certain work schedule, although community-driven projects have a more flexible schedule (in some cases having a weekend activity that surpasses that of weekdays).</li>
                                    <li>The presence of a <span class="focus">small but vital development team</span> is a common pattern, both for community-driven and company-backed/sponsored projects.</li>
                                  </ul><br>
                                  <li><span class="focus"><strong>Communities</strong>: we also notice common patterns when it comes to a project's community and interactions with it</span></li>
                                  <ul class="text-white-50 text-lg-left">
                                    <li><span class="focus">Communication</span>: being neutral when communicating is the go-to behavior among contributors and between contributors and the community. Still, interactions are generally slightly more positive than negative.</li>
                                    <li>Having a <span class="focus">popular community on StackOverflow/Reddit</span> is also common, suggesting the importance of encouraging the growth of the community.</li>
                                    <li>Having an <span class="focus">active/responsive community on StackOverflow</span> is another common pattern, which also makes sense as it's where people seek help to use a project.</li>
