              <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">The above graph represents the number of commits per project. It can be noted that there is an exponential trend for the distribution.

              <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Analyzing the distribution and the statistical parameters of the committer count and author count per project, it can be noticed that there is some difference, although it is minimal.

              <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Considering the results of the normalized mean time intervals, it can be seen that the previously discussed frequency interval (less than 1 day) remains valid. In fact, **a new range can be obtained (from 0.5 minute and up to 1.6 hours per commit per line of committed code)**. <span style="background:lightgreen">In short, these results provide **another common feature** among these **successful projects** and that is in relation to the **frequency of the commmits**. On average, a commit is made every 15 minutes per line of code. This represents the frequency/activity common to these successful project.</span> </p>

              <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">From the above plots, it can be seen that **the majority of projects are most active during weekdays, with a sharp drop during the weekends**. However, there are certain exceptions to this rule: `pandas-dev/pandas`, `numpy/numpy`, `pallets/flask`. This makes sense, as most people rest during the weekends.</p>

              <h4>Hour of the day? </h4>
              <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">From the above graph, it can be noticed that **all projects follow a similar daily time distribution**, where the activity increases to **reach a peak, then decreases constantly and hits a minimum for 6 to 8 hours** or so. <br> <br> This corresponds to **most of the commits happening during the working period**, with the least activity happening during the evening and at night. This makes sense for the following reasons: 1. For **team-driven projects**, a lot of the work will be happening during the **work hours** 2. For **other projects** and contributors in general, the contributors will also be following **daily schedules** (i.e. they sleep at night). <br> <br> While projects will have contributors from all around the world, the majority is likely to be from specific countries (e.g. China, India and the US are respectively ranked 1st, 2nd and 3rd in terms of Internet users, [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_Internet_users)) or specific to that project (e.g. `NervJS/nerv` seems to be driven by a Chinese community).</span> </p>

              <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">The projects that do not show as sharp a decline are, for example: pandas-dev/pandas, numpy/numpy and pallets/flask as mentioned above, as well as git/git, keras-team/keras, laravel/laravel rust-lang/rust and scikit-learn/scitkit-learn. Except Rust (which is sponsored by mozilla), these are all community-driven (although some might be sponsored). Keras also recently started to be officially backed by Google (source), although the project has existed since early 2015, so the mean showing this result also makes sense.</p>

This shows the importance of dealing with issues and can be related to the success of a project. Furthermore, it shows that the role of dealing with issues is distributed over a wide range of the authors involved.

This is highly variable from one project to another, with some projects being much faster in resolving issues (a couple of weeks), and other beings much slower (a few months). The big range of the resolution time is likely due to the nature of the project and its issues, some projects/issues being inherently more complex than others. This means that issues require more time to properly debug and fix. Still, the projects are responsive in most cases, with the 2nd quartile (50%) of average issue resolution time being a couple of months on average. This is acceptable considering the amount of time required to inquire about the issue, debug it, fix it and test the final outcome. <span style="background:lightgreen">Thus, these results provide **another common feature** among these **successful projects** and that is in relation to **the average time required to resolve issues**.

This is expected since commit messages have a descriptive and informative function (to provide concisely and objectively the commit's purpose). While the GitHub issues also have mostly neutral sentiments (on average ~99.5%), the amount of positive sentiments on GitHub (on average ~4.6% with stddev ~1.5%) is significantly higher than the negative ones (on average ~0.5% with stddev ~0.5%). This result could indicate a more positive and motivated community that is answering the issues, which might be related to the success.<br> <br> <br> <span style="background:lightgreen">Thus, these results provide **another common feature** among these **successful projects** and that is in relation to the **sentiment in their online communication**. Generally the neutral sentiment is highly dominating in commit messages and GitHub issues; when replying to the GitHub issues in the form of **GitHub comments**, the **sentiment tends to be more positive than negative (~4.6% vs ~0.5%)**.</span> The type of communication seems to play an important role in these community-driven project.
